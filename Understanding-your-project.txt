Understanding your project

This worksheet is to help capture your vision for the project.

Kindly complete this worksheet. Think of this document as a business plan for your project. We realize it’s quite a bit to ask upfront, but the more information you can give, the better we’ll be able to gain an understanding of the project.

Because each member of your team may have a different vision for the project, we recommend completing this worksheet as a group. That way we won't miss any important information. Once you’re happy that the worksheet clearly describes your project, submit the form and we’ll be in touch soon.

Please skip any questions that don’t pertain to your project.
