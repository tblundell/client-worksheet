# client-worksheet

This worksheet is to help capture the clients vision, needs, requirements and other relvant information for a project. 

The information is not only for the production team, but to help the client step back and explore and express there project idea. Clients can engage a design (and production) with a solution already in mind, without any investigation or knowledge currency into whether that would infact be the best solution.
